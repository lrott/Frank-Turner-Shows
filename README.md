Dataset and related materials for Frank Turner show history

Tableau viz viewable at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/publish/FrankTurnerShowHistory/FrankTurnerShows

Show data is scraped from http://www.frank-turner.com/basic-archive

Latitude and longitude data is pulled from the GeoLite database: http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/#Databases

Note: I do not claim to be an expert in UK geography so some of the towns may be in the wrong place (e.g. Southend on Frank's website meant Southend-on-Sea, not one of the many other Southends in the country). If you see an error please feel free to let me know and I'll get it corrected.

Manual adjustments made to the dataset:
<ul>
<li>Fixed many misspellings (e.g. Porland fixed to Portland, Shenzen to Shenzhen, Talinn to Tallinn)</li>
<li>Standardized the name for Ireland by replacing "Eire"</li>
<li>Tried to match festival locations with their closest town/hamlet where available</li>
<li>Comma was missing between Cambridge and MA for show #1262</li>
<li>Combined England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland into the UK. I may break them back out in the future</li>
<li>For the Salty Dog Cruise shows (#1642-1645) the lat/long address is a point equidistant between Miami and Nassau
</ul>
